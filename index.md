title: Yo Yehudi - Community Leadership and Compassionate Tech
---


## About me
My claims to fame: I have three passports, and I once assisted in a WW2 bomb disposal. I'm now happily settled in the UK with full British citizenship. Most recently I've had a mix of community-oriented, academic, technical project management and developer roles. In my spare time you’ll probably find me outdoors on my bike or with my nose buried in a book.

## Skills & Competencies
### Community
Community, technical, and project leadership at various different scales, ranging from co-founding and running the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) (https://openlifesci.org/) open training program for researchers, hosting collaborative community calls, running and developing [training workshops](http://intermine.org/training-workshops/), managing open source issues and pull requests via [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and [First-Timers-Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/), managing intern programs such as [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), organising conferences ([FOSDEM 2022 Open Research track](https://www.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/open_research_tools_and_technologies/) [MozFest 2018 Openness space wrangler](https://www.mozillafestival.org/), [BOSC 2019 and 2020 organising committee](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/)). [Open Source and Git training for newbies](https://open-source-for-researchers.github.io/open-source-workshop/).

## Recent Experience  

### Open Life Science - co-founder and Executive director
_July 2019 - founded. Feb 2022 - ongoing as Executive Director_  
Open Life Science is a training and mentoring organisation dedicated to advancing equitable open science by training and mentoring open science ambassadors. We run 16-week programs teaching participants about the basics of open science tooling and community building. Participants come from varied backgrounds including research software, hardware, wet lab, social sciences, anthropology and archaeology, and more. Our community currently has over 400 participants, mentors, and open science experts, and has trained 147 program participants to date, and as of August 2022 we're running our 6th iteration of training.

#### Current Funding
- £99,999 GBP from the Wellcome Trust, 2022-2023
- $574,945 USD from the Chan Zuckerburg Initiative, 2022-2023

### Wellcome Trust - Open Source Technology Lead, Data For Science and Health
_August 2020 - Jan 2022_  
Management role leading open source and research software engineering related initiatives in the Data for Science and Health team. This role requires a combination of stakeholder management, internal and external speaking, and finding suitable candidates for technology-related grant awards and contracts that advance Wellcome's mission. Communicating the strategic importance of technical subjects to non-technical researchers and grantmakers was a significant part of this.

#### Achievements include
- Grant award to the Research Software Alliance, funding work to define FAIR for software.
- Funding ten Outreachy interns (an initiative helping more underrepresented and marginalised people work in open tech) specifically for research projects that advance Wellcome's strategy
- Leading collaborations with external stakeholders, working on projects in Antimicrobial resistance and better clinical data sharing.

### University of Cambridge - Software Engineer and Community Manager
_July 2015 - July 2020_  
InterMine [http://intermine.org/](http://intermine.org/) is based at the Department of Genetics in Cambridge. When I joined, my focus was on developing InterMine’s new Clojure/ClojureScript-based user interface, BlueGenes [http://bluegenes.apps.intermine.org/](http://bluegenes.apps.intermine.org/). My activities ranged from early requirements gathering and mockups to user testing, development, and release. Over time, I picked up a more community-management oriented role, running community calls, encouraging community open source contributions, designing and delivering training workshops, and maintaining social media streams (Twitter: [@intermineorg](http://www.twitter.com/intermineorg)) and the InterMine blog [https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/). I lead InterMine’s participation in Google Summer of Code (2017, 2018, and 2019) as an organisation administrator and mentor.

#### Achievements include
- Lead-authored a Wellcome Diversity Enrichment grant (Awarded in 2019 to Gos Micklem, the InterMine PI) to recruit three Outreachy interns.
- Authored two ELIXIR staff exchange grants (awarded 2019).
- Successfully keeping ongoing engagement from previous Google Summer of Code students - five out of out six 2018 students returned as mentors, interns, or staff members in 2019.
- Highly effective community engagement via open source contributions - our last four team hires (on a stable, small team of seven with little turnover) have been either GSoC students or Hacktoberfest contributors.
- Implemented a [Code of Conduct](http://intermine.org/code-of-conduct/) for the InterMine projects.
- Created an open-source cross-repository Github open ticket portal to help new contributors find issues suitable for their skills ([source](https://github.com/yochannah/first-ticket-finder), [demo](http://intermine.org/contributing/))

### CapitalOne - Senior Associate Software Engineer
_(August 2014 - July 2015)_  
As a software engineer at CapitalOne I was part of an Agile team responsible for creating content and functionality updates to our high-traffic website. Typical duties included creating high-quality reusable module-pattern Javascript to enable enhanced interactive functionalities for credit card applicants.

## Project Lead and Developer - K-Now
_(Jan 2013 - July 2014)_  
As Project Lead, I was responsible for client and partner liaison, in both commercial projects and multimillion Euro EU research projects. I regularly represented K-Now in conferences, exhibitions, and meetings both in the UK and abroad. I also contributed to research project deliverables, created business proposals for potential clients, and oversaw technical exercises.

#### Achievements include  
- Overseeing the development and successful technical deployment of Android and Web software used by 50-60 volunteers during a WWII bomb disposal evacuation of 27,000 people in Vicenza, Italy.
- Successfully challenging an iOS App Store listing refusal (due to purported copyright reasons), working against slim deadlines and preventing the loss of a large contract.
- Completing technical implementation of a network-visualisation software contract with a large aerospace manufacturer based in Derby. This lead to K-Now successfully gaining an extension, generating further revenue for the company.

My responsibilities included design and development of K-Now's data visualisation platform, primarily from the front end using Javascript and popular libraries, including jQuery, Underscore, D3.js and Highcharts. This platform was successfully used in multiple commercial endeavours.
I also enjoyed working as an Android developer, learning standard Android design patterns and methodologies. Several of the applications I worked on were available on the Google Play store.

### Front End Web Manager - MattressOnline.co.uk
_(Jan 2011 - Dec 2012)_  
Front-end web manager: I have experience dealing with all aspects of the front end of a growing web company, from on-page SEO, to graphical content creation, analytics reporting and copywriting.
While I inherited the incumbent MattressOnline site, I was able to design and implement the front ends of several specialist satellite sites to target specific brands. The majority of my work was carried out in PHP, JavaScript, XML, and Photoshop. The role was design-heavy, and though slightly dated, some of my graphical work can be found here: [https://www.behance.net/yoyehudi/](https://www.behance.net/yoyehudi/)  
**Achievement:** Within a year of my joining MattressOnline, web turnover had doubled - I believe a large part of this was down to my conscientious and dedicated front-end management.

### 2nd Line Technical Analyst - Fujitsu & Computacenter
_(Mar 07 - Dec 10)_  
As a second-line analyst for HBOS (now part of Lloyds Banking Group), my role revolved around resolving IT faults for users swiftly and efficiently. When possible I talked the users through a resolution on the phone, or remotely accessed their PC. If necessary, I’d dispatch an engineer with appropriate hardware replacements parts. I have particular experience with HP PCs, laptops, and laser printers. My role required strong organisational and documentation skills and familiarity/adherence with existing procedures.
