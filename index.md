title: Yo Yehudi - Developer and Community Lead
---


## About me
My claim to fame: I have three passports. I'm now happily settled in the UK with full British citizenship. Most recently I've had a mix of community-oriented, academic, technical project management and developer roles. In my spare time you’ll probably find me outdoors on my bike or with my nose buried in a book.

## Skills & Competencies

[Open Source and Git training for newbies](https://github.com/open-source-for-researchers).
### Writing
Grant and business proposals, papers and research deliverables, technical documentation. Sponsorship requests. Community outreach & blogging, particularly when open source oriented.
### Technical

## Recent Experience  

### University of Cambridge - Software Engineer
_July 2015 - Ongoing_  
I currently work on the open source project InterMine [http://intermine.org/](http://intermine.org/), based at the Department of Genetics in Cambridge, developing InterMine’s new Clojure/ClojureScript-based user interface, BlueGenes [http://bluegenes.apps.intermine.org/](http://bluegenes.apps.intermine.org/). My activities range from early requirements gathering and mockups to user testing, development, and release.
As well as my technical duties, I enjoy my role as community manager, running community calls, encoraging community open source contributions, designing and delivering training workshops, and maintaining social media streams (Twitter: [@intermineorg](http://www.twitter.com/intermineorg), [@gmodproject](http://www.twitter.com/gmodproject)) and the InterMine blog [https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/). I led InterMine’s participation in Google Summer of Code (2017, 2018, and 2019) as an organisation administrator and mentor. 
#### Achievements include 
- Successfully keeping ongoing engagement from previous Google Summer of Code students - five out of out six 2018 students returned as mentors, interns, or staff members in 2019. 
- Highly effective community engagement via open source contributions - our last two team hires (on a stable, small team of seven with little turnober) have been either GSoC students or Hacktoberfest contributors. 

### CapitalOne - Senior Associate Software Engineer
_(August 2014 - July 2015)_  
As a software engineer at CapitalOne I was part of an Agile team responsible for creating content and functionality updates to our high-traffic website. Typical duties included creating high-quality reusable module-pattern Javascript to enable enhanced interactive functionalities for credit card applicants.

## Project Lead and Developer - K-Now
_(Jan 2013 - July 2014)_  
As Project Lead, I was responsible for client and partner liaison, in both commercial projects and multimillion Euro EU research projects. I regularly represented K-Now in conferences, exhibitions, and meetings both in the UK and abroad. I also contributed to research project deliverables, created business proposals for potential clients, and oversaw technical exercises.

#### Achievements include  
- Overseeing the development and successful technical deployment of Android and Web software used by 50-60 volunteers during a WWII bomb disposal evacuation of 27,000 people in Vicenza, Italy.
- Successfully challenging an iOS App Store listing refusal (due to purported copyright reasons), working against slim deadlines and preventing the loss of a large contract.
- Completing technical implementation of a network-visualisation software contract with a large aerospace manufacturer based in Derby. This lead to K-Now successfully gaining an extension, generating further revenue for the company.

My responsibilities included design and development of K-Now's data visualisation platform, primarily from the front end using Javascript and popular libraries, including jQuery, Underscore, D3.js and Highcharts. This platform was successfully used in multiple commercial endeavours.
I also enjoyed working as an Android developer, learning standard Android design patterns and methodologies. Several of the applications I worked on were available on the Google Play store.

### Front End Web Manager - MattressOnline.co.uk
_(Jan 2011 - Dec 2012)_  
Front-end web manager: I have experience dealing with all aspects of the front end of a growing web company, from on-page SEO, to graphical content creation, analytics reporting and copywriting.
While I inherited the incumbent MattressOnline site, I was able to design and implement the front ends of several specialist satellite sites to target specific brands. The majority of my work was carried out in PHP, JavaScript, XML, and Photoshop. The role was design-heavy, and though slightly dated, some of my graphical work can be found here: [https://www.behance.net/yoyehudi/](https://www.behance.net/yoyehudi/)  
**Achievement:** Within a year of my joining MattressOnline, web turnover had doubled - I believe a large part of this was down to my conscientious and dedicated front-end management.

### 2nd Line Technical Analyst - Fujitsu & Computacenter
_(Mar 07 - Dec 10)_  
As a second-line analyst for HBOS (now part of Lloyds Banking Group), my role revolved around resolving IT faults for users swiftly and efficiently. When possible I talked the users through a resolution on the phone, or remotely accessed their PC. If necessary, I’d dispatch an engineer with appropriate hardware replacements parts. I have particular experience with HP PCs, laptops, and laser printers. My role required strong organisational and documentation skills and familiarity/adherence with existing procedures.
